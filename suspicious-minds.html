    <h1>Suspicious Minds<h1>
      <h2>About</h2>
        <p>"Suspicious Minds" is a song written and first recorded by American songwriter Mark James. After James' recording failed commercially, the song was handed to Elvis Presley by producer Chips Moman, becoming a number one song in 1969, and one of the most notable hits of Presley's career. "Suspicious Minds" was widely regarded as the single that returned Presley's career success, following his '68 Comeback Special. It was his eighteenth and last number-one single in the United States. Rolling Stone ranked it No. 91 on their list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. Session guitarist Reggie Young played on both the James and Presley versions.</p>
      <h2>Song Lyrics</h2>
        <p>
          We're caught in a trap<br>
          I can't walk out<br>
          Because I love you too much, baby<br>
        </p>
        <p>
          Why can't you see<br>
          What you're doing to me<br>
          When you don't believe a word I say?<br>
        </p>

        <p>
          We can't go on together<br>
          With suspicious minds (suspicious minds)<br>
          And we can't build our dreams<br>
          On suspicious minds<br>
        </p>

        <p>
          So, if an old friend I know<br>
          Stops by to say hello<br>
          Would I still see suspicion in your eyes?<br>
        </p>

        <p>
          Here we go again<br>
          Asking where I've been<br>
          You can't see the tears are real<br>
          I'm crying (Yes, I'm crying)<br>
        </p>

        <p>
          We can't go on together<br>
          With suspicious minds (suspicious minds)<br>
          And we can't build our dreams<br>
          On suspicious minds<br>
        </p>

        <p>
          Oh, let our love survive<br>
          Or dry the tears from your eyes<br>
          Let's don't let a good thing die<br>
          When, honey, you know<br>
          I've never lied to you<br>
          Mmm, yeah, yeah<br>
        </p>

        <p>
          We're caught in a trap<br>
          I can't walk out<br>
          Because I love you too much, baby<br>
        </p>

        <p>
          Why can't you see<br>
          What you're doing to me<br>
          When you don't believe a word I say?<br>
        </p>

        <p>
          Don't you know I'm caught in a trap<br>
          I can't walk out<br>
          Because I love you too much, baby<br>
        </p>

        <p>
          Don't you know I'm caught in a trap<br>
          I can't walk out<br>
          Because I love you too much, baby<br>
        </p>

        <p>
          Don't you know I'm caught in a trap<br>
          I can't walk out<br>
          Because I love you too much, baby<br>
        </p>

        <p>
          Don't you know I'm caught in a trap<br>
          I can't walk out<br>
          Because I love you too much, baby<br>
        </p>

        <p>
          Don't you know I'm caught in a trap<br>
          I can't walk out<br>
          Because I love you too much, baby<br>
        </p>

        <p>
          Don't you know I'm caught in a trap<br>
          I can't walk out<br>
          Because I love you too much, baby<br>
